# api-spotify:

my ideas so far:

 - use Python to build a command-line interface (CLI) for controlling playback on a user's Spotify account. 
 - analyze the audio features to classify the track: use machine learning algorithms to analyze the audio features and classify the track based on its genre, mood, or other attributes.
